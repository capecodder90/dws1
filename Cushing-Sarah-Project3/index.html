		  	<p>The <strong>Chevrolet Silverado</strong> and its mechanically identical cousin, the <strong>GMC Sierra</strong> is a series of full-size and heavy-duty pickup trucks manufactured by General Motors and introduced in 1998 as the successor to the long-running Chevrolet C/K line. The Silverado name was taken from a trim level previously used on its predecessor, the Chevrolet C/K pickup trucks and Suburbans from 1975 through 1999. General Motors continues to offer a GMC-badged variant of the Chevrolet full-size pickup under the <strong>GMC Sierra</strong> name, first used in 1988 for its variant of the GMT400 platform trucks.</p>
		  	<h2><a id="history"></a>History</h2>
		  	<p>Although General Motors introduced its first pickup truck in 1930, the term "Silverado" was a designation used only to detail the trim for the Chevrolet C/K pickup trucks and Suburbans from 1975 through 1999. GMC used a few variations of the "Sierra" name (Sierra, High Sierra). However Chevrolet still uses the CK and the CC in their current model codes.</p>
		  	<p>The <abbr title="Chevrolet">Chevy</abbr> Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks have been essentially the same for their entire history. The Silverado today is generally advertised as the "standard" version and is more aimed for use in agriculture, while the Sierra is aimed for industrial workers but can be ordered as a well equipped luxury truck. There are some trim and option variations as well. Early models included variations in the engine and equipment, but the present differences are slight. The 1999 redesign included different grilles and interior trim, and certain features (e.g. Quadrasteer) were included at different times on the two trucks. Chevrolet did not create a Denali equivalent for the Silverado. However, the GMC Sierra has a Denali model.</p>
		  	<h2>First Generation (1999&mdash;2007)</h2>
		  	<p>The GMT800 Silverado/Sierra 1500 (light pickup trucks) were released in 1998 as 1999 models. The "classic" light-duty GMT400 C/K trucks were continued in production for that first year alongside the new models, and the Heavy-Duty GMT400 pickups (alongside the GMT400 SUVs) were continued through 2000, with the new GMT800 Silverado/Sierra HD (Heavy Duty) being introduced. A small refresh was introduced in 2002, bringing slight design changes and an upgrade to the audio and HVAC controls.</p>
		  	<h3><a id="bodies"></a>Body style changes</h3>
		  	<p>There was a midyear body style change in 2007. During this change, the first generation ends and the second generation begins. This body style is referred to as "Classic". The second generation is referred to as the "New body style".</p>
		  	<h4><a id="light-duty"></a>Light duty</h4>
		  	<p>There are a number of models of light-duty Silverados and Sierras, including the half-ton, SS, and <strong>Hybrid</strong>.</p>
		  	<p>The light-duty trucks generally use the 1500 name. They are available in three cab lengths, 2-door standard/regular cab, 4-door extended cab, and front-hinged 4-door crew cab Three cargo beds are available, including a 69.2 in (1,758 mm) short box, 78.7 in (1,999 mm) standard box, and a 97.6 in (2,479 mm) long box. The short box is only available with the extended or crew cab, and is the only option on the latter. The new trucks used a new hydro-formed technology on the frame which GM pioneered from the Corvette and was designed to add strength and take away mass and was later used by Ford and Dodge Ram.</p>
		  	<p>For the first year, only the regular cab and 3-door extended cab were available, along with the Vortec 4300 V6, Vortec 4800 V8, and the Vortec 5300 V8. A 4-door extended cab was added for 2000, and output on the 5.3 L engine increased to 285 hp (213 kW) and 325 lb·ft (441 N·m).</p>
		  	<p>The 6.0 L Vortec 6000 V8 was added for the 2001 Heavy Duty models, rated at 300 hp (224 kW), with the GMC Sierra 1500 C3 getting an uprated 25 hp (19 kW) version of this engine. The Silverado Z71 got an optional lighter composite box, with a suspension package for towing, but lacked the high-output engine. The C3 became the Denali for 2002, and Quadrasteer was added.</p>
		  	<p>GM introducing a reworked version of the Silverado/Sierra in 2002, with a new front end, and a slightly updated rear end. In 2006 the Silverado received another facelift, similar to the HD version introduced in 2005 HD models. In addition to that, Chevrolet has deleted the "Chevrolet" badge off the tailgate that was used from 1999-2005. Its SUV counterparts retained the use of the pre-facelift sheetmetal.</p>
		  	<p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the Silverado an overall "marginal" score on the frontal offset crash test for poor structural integrity and poor dummy control, although no injuries were recorded on the dummy's body regions.</p>
		  	<h5><a id="c3-denali"></a>2001 GMC Sierra C3/Denali</h5>
		  	<p>GMC created an upscale version of its Sierra 1500 in 2000 called the Sierra C3. It used all-wheel drive with a 3.73 final drive gear ratio and included the 6.0 L Vortec 6000 LQ4 V8 rated at 325 hp (242 kW) at 5000 rpm and 370 lb•ft (502 N·m) of torque at 4000 rpm coupled to a 4L60E-HD four speed automatic transmission along with other upscale equipment. For 2002, the name was changed to Sierra Denali, but the specifications remained essentially the same except for the addition of Quadrasteer and GM changed from the 4L60E-HD to the 4L65E in conjunction with a 4.10 final drive gear ratio.</p>
		  	<p>The Denali is rated for towing 9,100 pounds (4,100 kg) and hauling 1,595 pounds (723 kg) in the cargo box.</p>
		  	<p>The Sierra Denali was initially equipped with Delphi's Quadrasteer system as standard equipment. It was a 4-wheel steering system that greatly reduced the truck's turning radius and improved lane changing while towing. General Motors dropped Quadrasteer from the Sierra Denali after the 2004 model year and its entire lineup after 2005 due to poor sales of this expensive option.</p>
		  	<p>For the '07 model year, the Sierra Denali shares the same billet grille from the other Denali models, and also has the same dash as the '07 SUV's. The '07 Sierra Denali was initially the only half ton pickup that had a 6.2 liter with 403 hp (301 kW) and 417 lb·ft (565 N·m) of torque coupled to a six speed transmission. This truck is also an optional all wheel drive vehicle and goes 0-60 mph in 6.3 seconds.</p>
		  	<h5><a id="ss"></a>Chevrolet Silverado SS</h5>
		  	<p>Launched in early 2003, the Silverado SS is a high-performance pickup truck built by Chevrolet. It is based on the 1500 Silverado with upgrades in drive train and both exterior and interior appearance. It was equipped standard with the 6.0 liter Vortec High-Output V8 rated at 345 hp (257 kW) at 5200 rpm and 380 lb·ft (515 N·m) of torque at 4000 rpm coupled to a 4L65E four speed automatic transmission. This was the same engine used for the second generation Cadillac Escalade. Chevrolet and GMC advertised this engine as the Vortec High Output and later as the "VortecMAX", while Cadillac calls it the "HO 6000". The SS debuted in 2003 with a standard All Wheel Drive setup with a 4.10 final drive gear ratio and 4 wheel disc brakes. In 2004, in an attempt to increase sales, a 2-wheel drive version became available (the 2WD SS also lost its rear disc brakes in favor of drums, as did the rest of the 1/2-ton GMT800s). 2005 was also the first year the sun roof was available in the SS line up. In 2005, the AWD variant was dropped and the rear wheel drive was the only driveline layout available. In a further effort to reduce cost, you could also get cloth interior and/ or bench seat. The Silverado SS also comes with the Z60 performance suspension and 20 inch aluminum wheels. All the SS trucks in both 2 wheel drive and AWD used the torsion bar style front suspension for better handling. It should also be noted the SS themed trucks were only available from the factory in Black Onyx, Victory Red, and Arrival Blue Metallic from 2003 to 2004. In 2004 Arrival Blue Metallic was dropped from the color choice and replaced with Silver Birch Metallic.</p>
		  	<h5><a id="intimidator"></a>Intimidator SS</h5>
		  	<p>In 2005, Chevrolet released a special edition Silverado SS under the name "Intimidator SS" (licensed by Dale Earnhardt Inc.) to honor the late Dale Earnhardt. The truck came with several minor appearance upgrades (rear spoiler, embroidered headrests, Intimidator custom badging), but was essentially just a regular Silverado SS. Of the 1,333 scheduled trucks, only 933 were made. These trucks were only available in Black Onyx exterior but could be ordered with cloth or leather interior.</p>
		  	<h5><a id="vortec-max"></a>Silverado Performance Edition/Vortec Max</h5>
		  	<p>The Silverado Performance Edition option (also known as the VHO by some enthusiasts) was first introduced in 2004 to a limited market (mainly consisting of Texas and several surrounding areas); it was available nationwide for MY 2005-07. The SPE package (under option code B4V) included several options previously not found on the standard 1500 model, most notably the LQ9 6.0 L V-8 engine (the same used for the Silverado SS, the 2005-2006 GMC Denalis and the Cadillac Escalade). The LQ9 motor was rated at 345 hp (257 kW) at 5200 rpm and 380 lb·ft (515 N·m) of torque at 4000 rpm, which was the same specifications shared in the SS models. The B4V package could only be ordered on extended cab standard box 2WD trucks. They were all built at the Canadian assembly plant and were equipped with the Z60 High Performance suspension package, in addition to the M32 = 4L65E transmission, GT4 = 3.73 rear gear, and G80 Gov Lock as standard equipment. The 2004 models were equipped with the standard 10 bolt 8.625 rear end. The 2005 models were upgraded with the larger 14 bolt 9.5 rear end under RPO option AXN. The package also included one style of the newly introduced GM 20 inch wheels installed from the factory. This marked the first time the LQ9 engine was available for a two wheel drive application. Unlike the SS Package you could order the interior combination in anything from basic cloth to fully loaded. There were also more color options available with this package.</p>
		  	<p>For the 2006 model year, the Vortec Max package (option code NHT) was added to the options list with an array of similar features and new badges. However, the Vortec Max package differed in that it came with a variant of the Z85 Handling/Trailering suspension, as well as 17-inch wheels and tires versus the Z60 High Performance Suspension and 20-inch wheel and tire package of the Performance Edition. This was because the Vortec Max package was intended for max trailer towing, while the Performance Edition was intended more for customers who wanted the Silverado SS mechanicals without the visuals of the SS. It was also made available (in addition to the extended cab) in the light duty 4 door crew cab models. For the first time it was also available in 2 wheel drive or 4 wheel drive on both the Silverados and Sierras, with or without Z71 packages.</p>
		  	<p>The newest Vortec Max Performance package introduced in 2007 on the GMT900 includes a 10,800 pounds towing capacity.</p>
		  	<h5><a id="hybrid"></a>Hybrid</h5>
		  	<p>GM launched a hybrid version of the Silverado/Sierra in 2004, becoming the first ever GM hybrid passenger vehicle. Known within GM as the Parallel Hybrid Truck or PHT it is not actually a parallel hybrid by the current definition, but a type of micro hybrid design. The electric motor housed within the transmission flywheel housing, serves only to provide engine cranking/starting, battery charging, and powering accessories. The engine automatically shuts down as the truck comes to a stop and uses 42 Volt electric power to the starter/generator unit to restart the engine as the brake pedal is released. Besides the typical 12 V automotive battery the PHT uses three additional 12 V valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries mounted under the rear seat to store and provide power. The truck uses a 5.3 L Vortec 5300 V8 for primary propulsion power. These trucks were also purchased back from customers for more than what they were worth in the late 2000s.</p>
		  	<p>The PHT features four 120 volt 20 amp AC outlets, two in the bed and two inside the cab under the rear seat. These are particularly interesting to the building/construction contractor market, since they often require AC power when on the job. Additionally, the extra reserves of power for the accessories make this truck well-suited to that market, where trucks often sit at idle for hours at a time.</p>
		  	<p>Availability was extremely limited at first, with commercial buyers getting the first allotment. Later in 2005, the truck was offered at retail in Alaska, California, Florida, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Canada. For 2006-07 the truck was generally available to retail buyers throughout North America. The Parallel Hybrid Truck was discontinued for the 2008 model year with the release of the GMT900 truck line. Starting in 2009, General Motors offers a second generation Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra equipped with a Two-Mode Hybrid powertrain and 4-speed CVT.</p>
		  	<h5><a id="heavy-duty"></a>Heavy Duty</h5>
		  	<p>The HD variant is a heavy-duty light truck. It is a strengthened version of the Silverado/Sierra light-duty, and is available in the 1500HD, 2500HD, and 3500 models. The 1500HD, introduced in 2000, offers a Vortec 6000 V8 with 300 hp (224 kW) at 5200 rpm and 360 lb·ft (488 N·m) of torque at 4000 rpm with a Hydra-Matic 4L80E four-speed automatic transmission. The 2500HD also offers an available Duramax V8 with 300 hp (224 kW) at 3100 rpm and 520 lb·ft (705 N·m) of torque at 1800 rpm. Also available is the Vortec 8100 V8 with 340 hp (254 kW) at 4200 rpm and 455 lb·ft (617 N·m) of torque at 3200 rpm.</p>
		  	<p>The 2500HD has an available five-speed (six-speed for 2006-2007 models) Allison 1000 transmission with the Vortec 8100 and Duramax 6.6. The Silverado 3500 offers the same engine/transmission features that the 2500HD does, however it is usually equipped with "dually" twin wheels at the rear and has a stronger suspension. The HD models are primarily used for towing and high-weight cargo.</p>
		  	<p>Towing capacity for the 1500HD is rated at 10,300 pounds (4,700 kg), and can haul 3,129 pounds (1,419 kg) in the bed. The 2500HD ups these ratings to 16,300 pounds (7,400 kg) with the 8.1 liter engine or 10,600 pounds (4,800 kg) with the 6.0 liter engine, and 4,058 pounds (1,841 kg), while the 3500 can tow 16,700 pounds (7,600 kg) and haul 5,511 pounds (2,500 kg). The addition of 4 wheel drive tends to reduce the towing and carrying capacity by 200 to 400 lb (181 kg), depending upon year and model. Other factors, such as options, can also affect these numbers.</p>
